# Secret Santa

This simple web application is used in order to draw names for Secret Santa. It requires an outside user to view the results of the drawings. In the first section, add the names of the people you wish to
"put in the hat". It must be an even number in order to create pairs. You can see the added participants to the right and remove if needed. Once finished, click "Draw". At this point the mechanics are locked
to prevent side effects. You can then "Show Results" to view the pairings. As well, you can click "Reset" to reset the flow and start again.

## Demo
View a live demo of the application [here](https://meestermarcus.github.io/secret-santa/). 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

To build the project for github pages, run `npm run build-gh`
